# Board Games ([[Board, Games]])

_By Connor Henderson_ [_visit Board Games_](link)

This website is for enjoying the logic of computers, board games, and writing board games on computers. Users compete for the high score against the CPU in Chess, Go, and Sudoku. For a break from games, users can make interesting visualizations of John Conway's "Game of Life" cellular automaton or select presets to run.

Future updates will include improved CPU playing in Go and chess.
